#  Check launchd Tasks
#	by Jedda Wignall
#	http://jedda.me

#	v1.0 - 1 Aug 2012
#	Initial release.

#	This script calls `launchctl list` and parses the output to report non-zero exit codes for tasks. This is very useful in
#	finding tasks that cannot launch and are 'Throttling respawn', as well as locating bad exit codes for scheduled tasks.

#	!! IMPORTANT: It is important that the script is run as a super user so that system tasks are included - otherwise you are just monitoring
#	tasks in the 'local' domain, which is unlikely to be anything you care about.

#	The preset_exceptions array below exists because some tasks exit with non-zero codes as standard, such as Apple's XProtect
#	anti-malware tool, which exits with a code of 252 when there are no new definitions on Apple's server. The execptions allow
# 	for these kind of known tasks whose exit status is not pertinent to the monitoring of the system.

# 	The -e flag allows you to supply extra exceptions as an argument. This is a comma delimited list of identifiers (see example below).

# 	The -c flag allows you to supply critical processes as an argument. This is a comma delimited list of identifiers (see example below).
#	The default return for finding a process with a non-zero exit code is WARNING. This allows you to define processes that
#	will return CRITICAL.

#	The script takes the above arguments like this:
#	./check_osx_launchd.sh -e com.apple.iCloudHelper,com.apple.NotesMigratorService -c com.apple.servermgrd
