I originally wanted to include Mylar and Gamez as well but Gamez' API is currently not working and Mylar's API is currently disabled as the developer wants to focus on fixing major issues with Mylar first. 

## Disclaimer

This is my first Windows 8 app and is a completely new learning experience for me. It's entirely possible things might not work. Please let me know if you find any issues.
This project is still very heavily under development.

This is a Visual Studio 2012 project so if you would like to test/build this you will need VS2012 to run this. Open the .jsproj file in VS2012 and press F5 to run it. It will now appear on your start screen.
